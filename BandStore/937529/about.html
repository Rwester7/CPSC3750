                Bruce Springsteen, nicknamed "The Boss," is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist who is backed by the E Street Band, named after the street in Belmar, New Jersey where an early member lived. Springsteen, also from New Jersey
                formed the E street band due to many factors, like existing connections, after he signed a record deal with Columbia Records. His big breakout was his third album "Born to Run" in 1975 which brought him huge success. The 
                iconic songs like "Thunder Road" and "Jungleland" showed his distinct style, lyrics, and sound. "Born to Run" was followed up by "Darkness on the Edge of Town" which was a completely different style than "Born to Run" with
                songs like "Badlands" and the title track "Darkness on the Edge of Town." He strove to make only songs that fit his narrative in the story he wanted to tell with this album and cut many songs that were later put on other
                albums such as an album comprised of cut songs like that that eventually turned into hits as well. This second hit helped solidify Springsteens talent and influence.

                Bruce Springsteen has had such an impact that many documentaries and some movies, such as "Blinded by the Light" which is about someone discovering his music, have been made about him. He had also made an autobiography and
                a Broadway Show, "Springsteen on Broadway." He had won many awards, 7 Grammys, 1 Tony, 2 Golden Globes, 1 Academy Award/Oscar, 1 Emmy, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999.
                Many of his awards are due to the song "Streets of Philidelphia" which he wrote for the movie "Philadelphia" where he won Song of the Year and Best Rock Song at the Grammys, Best Original Song at the Oscars, and Best Original 
                Song at the Golden Globes.
